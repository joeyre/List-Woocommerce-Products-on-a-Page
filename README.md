# List-Woocommerce-Products-on-a-Page
How to list the latest products on a particular WordPress page, from WooCommerce.

You can copy and paste the code from the woocommerce-products.php into any page (I use it on my home page) to display the latest 4 products. 

# Change number of products 

You can change the amount of products by editing number here: 'posts_per_page' => 4

# Change size of image thumbnails

By default, this code will is responsive and display whatever you have in your Thumbs set up. If you want to be more specific, see here: https://github.com/joeyre/WordPress-Responsive-Featured-Images
